# project-athenas
Athenas is an online resource based website for students. It is a project site, determined to model the conception of the idea, and it is not a commercially functioning website.

_Tech Stacks:_ Django, Tailwind CSS, and Next JS

_Deployment:_ PythonAnywhere

_Functionalities:_ User Authentication, Contact model, and login/logout updates.


**Note:** It is not a fully functioning website, and is just a model concept, representing my idea and my full-stack skills. If you wanna contribute, add new functionalities, you are most welcome. Do let me know.
